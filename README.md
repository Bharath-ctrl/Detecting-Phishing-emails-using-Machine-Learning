# Detecting-Phishing-emails-using-Machine-Learning-in-real-time
The Project focuses of Real-time detection of phishing emails. 
Accessing the email data=> we access this data/email through imap server
iMAP servers are the servers where all the emails are received(before it was POP3 , now everything is done through iMAP servers).
we provide the credentials through which we can connect to the iMAP servers.So, before you can access the imap, you need to enable, allow less secure apps to access the server ( https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps?pli=1&rapt=AEjHL4PhmL-cGPUbLnYqge5EVy_11Duwvwt8UvGzu4wToOx2lKPB0h6RJK-JvswE6OqrXiTd71TTJkgr7KZI9fhiN7HVTGOk1w ).
NOTE: you can only enable this feature if and only if you have an organization mail id.Google no longer supports the use of third-party apps or devices which ask you to sign in to your Google Account using only your username and password.

I have developed a Chrome extension to show the count the total phishing emails detected.

Steps(application) to run the project as per the names given in the project:
1: Run app.py 
2: Run mail_fetch.py 
3: check in the chrome extension and click on report

For the machine learning part, I have used Naive bayes multinomial for the text classification and Random Forest classifier for the URL Classification. The data to check is got from the HTML Body of the email from the iMAP server.
Here is the report which we have prepared for the college:
