# Detecting-Phishing-emails-using-Machine-Learning-in-real-time
The Project focuses of Real-time detection of phishing emails. 
Accessing the email data=> we access this data/email through imap server
iMAP servers are the servers where all the emails are received(before it was POP3 , now everything is done through iMAP servers).
we provide the credentials through which we can connect to the iMAP servers.So, before you can access the imap, you need to enable, allow less secure apps to access the server ( https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps?pli=1&rapt=AEjHL4PhmL-cGPUbLnYqge5EVy_11Duwvwt8UvGzu4wToOx2lKPB0h6RJK-JvswE6OqrXiTd71TTJkgr7KZI9fhiN7HVTGOk1w ).
NOTE: you can only enable this feature if and only if you have an organization mail id.Google no longer supports the use of third-party apps or devices which ask you to sign in to your Google Account using only your username and password.

I have developed a Chrome extension to show the count the total phishing emails detected.
